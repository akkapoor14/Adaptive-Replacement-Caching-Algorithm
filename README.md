For our COS316 project, my group chose to implement the Adaptive Replacement Caching (ARC) algorithm as it is proven to offer significantly better performance than the Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm. While LRU only tracks recently used items, ARC tracks both frequently and recently accessed items. ARC is able to optimize for the most cache hits by dynamically balancing storage in the cache between frequently and recently accessed items through self-tuning. As a result, ARC is able to evolve with changing access patterns. ARC is able to cache items while maintaining a constant time complexity per request and a low space overhead. Finally, ARC has the advantageous property of being scan resistant meaning that one-time sequential requests can pass through without polluting the cache or flushing items with temporal locality.
